# 📐 Numerical Methods in C

This repository contains a set of core **numerical methods implemented in C** for solving nonlinear equations. These algorithms are fundamental in numerical analysis and are widely used in engineering, physics, and computational mathematics where analytical solutions are not feasible.

## 🚀 Implemented Methods

- ✅ Bisection Method  
- ✅ Newton-Raphson Method  
- ✅ Secant Method  
- ✅ Regula Falsi (False Position) Method  
- ✅ Linear Search Method
- ✅ Variable Step Search

Each method is implemented in its own standalone `.c` file with clear code structure, comments, and sample input/output to demonstrate functionality.
